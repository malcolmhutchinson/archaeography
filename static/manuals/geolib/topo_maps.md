Topographic maps
================

[/geolib/topo/](/geolib/topo/)

We keep an index to the topographic map sheets covering New Zealand,
in three series. Our index links to geotiff format files available on
public servers at LINZ and the University of Auckland.

The map series we index are:

-  NZMS1 one inch to one mile topographic series.

   Early archaeological sites carry identifiers based on this map
   series.

-  NZMS260 1:50,000 metric topographic series on NZ Map Grid (NSMG).

   The current [SRS](/manuals/nzaa/site_recording_scheme) is indexed
   by this map series.

-  Topo50 1:50,000 topographic series on NZTM 2000

   This series superseded NZMS260 and is the current national
   topographic map series.

The index of topographic maps enables the archaeography machine to
list all the archaeological site records which may be found on any
given map sheet.
