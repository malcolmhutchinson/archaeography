Topographic maps
================

[/geolib/topo/](/geolib/topo/)

We keep an index to the topographic map sheets covering New Zealand,
in four series. Our index links to geotiff format files available on
public servers at LINZ and the University of Auckland.

They start with copies of the NZMS1 series, in one-inch-to-one mile
scale, and include the NZMS260 metric series on which the
[SRS](/manuals/nzaa/site_recording_scheme) is based, and the Topo 50
series in present use.

The index enables the machine to list all the archaeological site
records which may be found on any given map sheet.
