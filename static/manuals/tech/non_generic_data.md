Non-generic data
================

Non-generic data are those data we hold on the system, which
change. These are distinct from library files, for example, which are
copies of static, unchanging datasets -- mostly the LINZ layers.

The non-generic data collection includes our copies of the NZAA
archaeological site records, and updates reviews and site lists
associated with them. Also, the tables recording historic aerial
photos.

Here are the non-generic tables:
