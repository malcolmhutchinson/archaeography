Create a new site record
========================

<p class='note'>See also <a href='/manuals/nzaa/new_site_record'>/manuals/nzaa/new_site_record</a></p>

This page explains how to create a record for a previously unrecorded
archaeological site.

To create a new site record, go to
[/nzaa/create/](/nzaa/create/). Fill out the
form. The fields are mostly self-explanatory.

    <tr>
        <th><p>Field id</p></th>

        <td><p>Field identifier. So you can refer back to your own naming
        scheme.</p></td>

        <td><p>Notes from your field book. This is a place for staging
        information, which you use to build your record with. The
        field notes will not be included in the final official record,
        but will be visible from it.</p>

        classifying some as "working", others as "staging",
        "standing", "completed", or "hold".  In a list of new records,
        you will be able to sort them by this status field.</p></td>

New site records are kept separate from the collection until a
filekeeper can assess them. 

A temporary identifier is assigned to each new site record. This is
based on the NZAA identifier, but uses the Topo50 map index instead of
the NZMS260 one. 



### Tips and tricks

Upload photographs or scans of your field notes, and refer to them in
the `field_notes` field. This helps keep all the information about a
site in one place. Notes will not be displayed in the site record.
