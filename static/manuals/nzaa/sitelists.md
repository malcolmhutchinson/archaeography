Sitelists: lists of archaeological site records
===============================================

Site lists are a way of arranging collections of site records. You can
create and delete as many site lists as you like, and each list can
have as many or as few archaeological site records in it.

You are the owner of any site list you create, and you may add or
remove site records from it or delete it at will. Other users may be
able to see your site lists, but they will not be able to change
anything about them

You can add records to, or remove them from, any site list you have
created.

You can view any site record in a list, and step forwards or backwards
through the records.
