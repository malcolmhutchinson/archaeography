Actors

An _actor_ in the context of this project, is a name extracted from
the archaeological site records. In most cases, these will be the
names of people who recorded or updated the the site records. There
are occasional site records which name an organisation in the
`recorded_by` field, which is why they are called _actors_ and not
_people_, or _archaeologists_.

The project compiles a raw list of the names extracted from the NZAA
site records, and records sites associated with that name. Many of the
names have multiple spellings for the same person, and other errors in
them, which make the list unsuitable for telling us much about the
work of individual archaeologists.
