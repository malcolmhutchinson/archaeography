Natural site groups
===================

Because of the large number of archaeolgical site records in the
[SRS](/manuals/nzaa/site_recording_scheme), it can be very useful to
divide the collection into subsets.

The Archaeography project provides a number of 'natural' subsets of
site records based on geograohic locations. These natural groups
include;

-   The Regions. You can select all the archaeological site records
    within the Hawkes' Bay Region, for example. There are 16 regions
    covering the main islands of New Zealand. Region boundaries are
    supplied by
    [Statistics NZ](http://localhost:9000/manuals/geolib/statsNZ).

-   Territorial Authorities.

-   The NZAA recording regions. These are 19 regions
    historically used by the NZAA to administer the Site Recording
    Scheme. They are based on collections of adjacent NZMS260
    topographic map sheets.

-   The NZMS260 topographic mpa sheets. The fundamental geographic
    unit of the SRS is the NZMS260 topographic map sheet. There are
    336 of these.

Links to the natural site groups are listed on the
[NZAA application page](/nzaa/).
