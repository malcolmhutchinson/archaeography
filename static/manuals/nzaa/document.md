A document with an NZAA site record
-----------------------------------

In this context a _document_ is the same thing a a file, which
has been uploaded to ArchSite with the site record.

We call them _documents_ as distinct from _files_ because we create
PNG format copies of most of them so they can be displayed inline in a
browser, so each document actually has more than one file associated
with it.

Many documents in the collection are scans of the original paper
pages. These arrive as .tiff image files, and each one is counted as a
document, with one page in it.

PDF files may have more than one page in them.  We create a PNG copy
for every page within a PDF, so that the whole document can be
displayed inline.

Counting documents and pages tells us how much information is held in
the SRS and how that information is distributed.
