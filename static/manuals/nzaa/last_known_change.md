Last known change
=================

The last known change records a timestamp when the record was last
updated with data from ArchSite.

Note that this is not the same as the date someone last changed the
site record. 

It records a timestamp relating to the
[scraping event](/manuals/nzaa/scraping_archsite)
which last changed our local copy of the site record.

The feature was implimented in July 2018, so this will be the earliest
change date recorded in the collection.

This is what enables us to find those site records which have been
created or updated recently.

Contrast this with [last checked](/manuals/nzaa/last_checked).  
See also [recent changes](/manuals/nzaa/recent_changes).
