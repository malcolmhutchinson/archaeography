Periods
=======

Period values are collected from site records as they are downloaded
from ArchSite. They indicate something of the age of the evidence
within the archaeological site.

The values are extracted from the "period" field in the ArchSite record, and separated by comma into a table of unique values.

Currently, there are four values for period existing in the
collection:

    Colonial 1840-1900
    Contact 1769-1840
    Indigenous pre-1769
    Modern 1900-

Most records have no value for period.
