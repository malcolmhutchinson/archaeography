Scraping ArchSite
=================

The archaeography project maintains copies of the records stored in
the [SRS](/manuals/nzaa/site_recording_scheme). It gets these copies
by running software which downloads them from the NZAA's website
[ArchSite](http://www.archsite.org.nz/).

The process of extracting data from a web page is called
[_scraping_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). 

Our software regularly scans through the collection of records in
ArchSite, and updates the local database where it finds changes.


ArchSite can be found at
