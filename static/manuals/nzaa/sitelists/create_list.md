Create a sitelist
=================

There are a number of ways you can create a site list.

1.  You can go to [/nzaa/sitelist/create/](/nzaa/sitelist/create/) and
    fill in the form.

1.  You can select site records from any other list, or group, of site
    records, and click the `new from selected` button. This will take
    you to the same form as the first method.

You must give your new sitelist a name.

It's a good idea to put list of keywords separated by commas in the
subject field, and a short paragraph in the description field.

The list type field is available for you to use with any arbitary
value accepted. It can be helpful for sorting lists of site lists.

The add sites field will accept a list of NZAA site identifiers,
separated by commas. The list may be arbitraily long. Individual
identifiers may be encased in single or double quotes, or the quote
may be ommitted.
