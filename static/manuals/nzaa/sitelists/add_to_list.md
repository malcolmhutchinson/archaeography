Add site records to a list
==========================

Typing site identifiers into the field on the site form, and clicking
`save`, will add those records to the current list. Multiple
identifiers can be entered, separated by commas.

It is possible to select records from most collections by clicking the
ckeckbox on the required records, selecting the list you want to add
them to, and clicking `add to list`.
