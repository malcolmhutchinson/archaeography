Update a site record
====================

This page explains how to compile an update to an existing site
record. 


Go to the site record you want to update. The URL will be:

    http://archaeography.nz/nzaa/[site identifier]

Where `[site identifier]` is the NZAA site id, eg
"[S22/4](/nzaa/S22/4)".

Look for 'update this site record' in the list of commands in the
navigation column. This will present you with a form containing the
fields of an archaeological site record.

Fill out as much as you like and click 'save'. You will be able to
continue editing your site record.

You can see a [list of your site update records](/manuals/nzaa/your_updates)
at any time.
