The NZAA Site Recording Scheme
==============================

The [New Zealand Archaeological Association](https://nzarchaeology.org/)
has been maintaining the
national database of archaeological sites since 1960. The Site
Recording Scheme (SRS) is the expression of that work in collecting
and collating records describing archaeological sites in New Zealand.

The SRS is made available by the NZAA via the website
<a href='http://www.archsite.org.nz/'>ArchSite</a>. 

The primary objective of the archaeography project is to model the SRS
in a spatially-enabled relational database management system.
