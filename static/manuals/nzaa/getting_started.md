Getting started with Archaeography.nz
=====================================

The centre of the Archaeography project is the model of the NZ
Archaeological Association's Site Recording Scheme (SRS).
This website holds a copy of the records in the SRS, and we perform
experiments on those records.

The place to start is the [NZAA application page](/nzaa/). Here, you
will see a list of ['natural' site groups](/manuals/nzaa/natural_groups)
-- these are the Regions, Territorial Authorities, the NZAA recording
regions and the NZMS260 map sheets.

You can view a list of all the archaeological sites in the
[Auckland region](/nzaa/auckland/), for example, by clicking on the
first entry in the first list on the page.

There are a number of things you can do from her:

-  Browse the collection of archaeological site records by natural
   groups.

-  Start building [site lists](/manuals/nzaa/site_lists) -- lists of
   site records which you control.

-  Create a new record, for an archaeological site which hasn't been
   recorded yet.

-  Compile an [update record](/manuals/nzaa/site_update), for an
   existing site.
