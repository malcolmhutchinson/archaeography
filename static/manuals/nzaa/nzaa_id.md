The NZAA site identifier
========================

The [SRS](/manuals/nzaa/site_recording_scheme)
provides a uniquie identifier for each archaeological site record. The
naming scheme is based on the NZMS260 topographic series map grid.

An archaeological site is identified by the NZMS 260 sheet it falls
on, and an incrimenting integer, separated by a slash.

Sites near the mouth of the Waikato River, on sheet NZMS260
[R13&nbsp;_Port&nbsp;Waikato_](/geolib/topo/NZMS260/527),
are identified this:

    R13/1
    R13/2
    R13/3 ...
    

The geolibrary contains a representation of the
[NZMS260](/geolib/topo/NZMS260) grid, as well as a copy of the map
sheet index for the series, supplied by LINZ.
