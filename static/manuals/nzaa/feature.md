Features
========

A feature is a discrete archaeological formation.  Features are
described in the archaeological site records.

The project compiles a raw list of the features extracted from the
NZAA site records, and lists sites associated with that feature.

So you can see <a href='/nzaa/features/177'>all the sites that report
'Mill' in their features</a>, for example.
