This is an experimental function. The object is to provide a mechanism
for compiling numbers of site records to add to the SRS.

It seemed best to separate out new site records from the collection
proper. This is so incomplete new records will not artificially inflate
the count of site records, and so some process for assessing
provisional site records can be provided. Some sort of formal
accessioning process.


Accessioning a new site record
-----------------------------

A new site record goes through a process That is, a record is created
by an archaeologist, and may be edited several times, before being
submitted to a filekeeper. This person will decide whether there is
sufficient information in the record for it to form part of the the
official collection. If so, the record will be moved into the site
file. If not, the filekeeper may elect to send it back to the
archaeologist with a query.

Each new site record will go through this process:

1.  A new site record is created by an archaeologist, from feild data,
    or remote sensing data, or historical information. This new record
    is assigned a site identifier based on the Topo50
    grid. e.g. "AW28/2", "BE34/2", etc.

1.  The archaeologist may upload field notes, photographs or other
    files in support of the site record. They may edit the information
    in the record many times.

1.  The archaeologist may record several related sites, and refer to
    them in the text of their record by the New Site identifier.

1.  Eventually, when the archaeologist considers the record complete,
    they may submit it for consideration by a filekeeper.

1.  The filekeeper will examine the record, and assess the quality and
    quantity of the archaeological evidence. They may send the record
    back to the archaeologist with a query, or accept it for
    accessioning into the official collection.

1.  When a record is accepted, a copy of it is made into the site
    table, and it is allocated an NZAA identifier. This new site
    record is then flagged 'accepted'.
