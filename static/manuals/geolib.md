Geographic library
==================

The geolibrary contains reference layers including roads, rail,
rivers, coastlines, and the like.

We use these layers for spatial computations, like what is the nearest
road, or named place, to a given archaeological site; or what region
or territorial authority is the site recorded in?

The data in these collections is provided by the New Zealand
Government under Creative Commons licenses, permitting their use,
distribution and re-use.
