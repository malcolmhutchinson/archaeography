Experiments with archaeological data.

The archaeography project is an experimental model of the [NZ
Archaeological Association's](http://nzarchaeology.org) (NZAA) Site
Recording Scheme (SRS). It is an engineering prototype, the purpose of
which is to provide understanding of the problems involved with
handling large volumes of information describing archaeological sites.

The Python code here expresses, in a Django web framework, some of the
functions of an information system for handling the records in the SRS.

NOTE: There are NO DATA BELONGING TO THE NZAA present in this
codebase.
